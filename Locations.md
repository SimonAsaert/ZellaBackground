### Pivrir's Respite

**Brief Description**

A small colonial settlement settled far North East from [Nevarro City](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nevarro_City "Wookiepedia"). The settlement sits at point where two lava-rivers join together, winding along the Northern and Eastern parts of the settlement. With the South being blocked with large, black hills covered in loose rocks and boulders.

The small settlement only has a few dozen structures, with housing, a cantina, storehouse, mechanic and a place for ships to land and trade. Every structure has been built elevated from the terrain, standing on narrow Ferrocrete pillars. Some structures with a section that does touch the ground for easier access but most have more temporary means of entering. From a rope-ladder that's freed by using a hook, to temporary stairs for those who had the resources and/or technical know-how. With the structures being seen to spill out over some of the river-flows.

#### Rough history

- Founded during Imperial control
- A minor bastion away from the capital for quiet independence
- When Imperial care pulled away, pirates were quick to lay their claws
- Theft arose first, tributes and enforced 'trading' pushed, before slaving began
- History since then is uncertain to Zella

### B&M's Workshop

**Brief Description**

This workshop stands as one of the structures with dedicated area for a ground-floor. Situated West of [Pivrir's Respite](#pivrirs-respite), it's one of the more recent builds of the settlement.

The segment that reaches the ground and upwards is the workshop area, with enough mechanical tools situated about to cover most situations. Though all the tools are old style, or have signs of being broken, worn down, patched or even having parts swapped from everywhere to try and get them in working shape. The workshop itself is kept with some semblance of order. Work-tables are kept cleared even if they're dirty and chipped, unused tools are hung up to be easily accessible. A lot of the materials are kept wherever there's space, with an assortment of boxes, or shelves, or for larger materials just hung up in the ceiling or leaning against the walls.

There's a door that leads to the residential part of the structure. While it's a cramped space, the rooms are covered with colour. Covered with tapestries, paintings, coloured pillows, art everywhere around the place. Featuring elements of life, wild joy, all the joyful emotions.

The rooms are split up into a single bedroom, a kitchen-living area combo, a washroom and a small room that acts as office-space with documents housing the work done and plans for what work needs to be completed, as well as a studio for more art to be created.
