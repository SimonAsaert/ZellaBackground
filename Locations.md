## Pivrir's Respite

> ### Summary <Pivrir>
>
> **Type**: Hamlet<br>
> **Location**: Navarro<br>
> **Main Faction(s)**: Independent<br>
> **Purpose**: Settlement, hideout<br>

### Brief Description <Pivrir>

A small colonial settlement settled far North East from [Nevarro City](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nevarro_City "Wookiepedia"). The settlement sits at point where two lava-rivers join together, winding along the Northern and Eastern parts of the settlement. With the South being blocked with large, black hills covered in loose rocks and boulders.

The small settlement only has a few dozen structures, with housing, a cantina, storehouse, mechanic and a place for ships to land and trade. Every structure has been built elevated from the terrain, standing on narrow Ferrocrete pillars. Some structures with a section that does touch the ground for easier access but most have more temporary means of entering. From a rope-ladder that's freed by using a hook, to temporary stairs for those who had the resources and/or technical know-how. With the structures being seen to spill out over some of the river-flows.

### Rough History <Pivrir>

- Founded during Imperial control
- A minor bastion away from the capital for quiet independence
- When Imperial care pulled away, pirates were quick to lay their claws
- Theft arose first, tributes and enforced 'trading' pushed, before slaving began
- History since then is uncertain to Zella

## B&M's Workshop

> ### Summary <BM>
>
> **Type**: Workstation<br>
> **Location**: Navarro<br>
> **Main Faction(s)**: Independent<br>
> **Purpose**: Repairs, refurbish and restoration of mechanics<br>

### Brief Description <BM>

This workshop stands as one of the structures with dedicated area for a ground-floor. Situated West of [Pivrir's Respite](#pivrirs-respite), it's one of the more recent builds of the settlement.

The segment that reaches the ground and upwards is the workshop area, with enough mechanical tools situated about to cover most situations. Though all the tools are old style, or have signs of being broken, worn down, patched or even having parts swapped from everywhere to try and get them in working shape. The workshop itself is kept with some semblance of order. Work-tables are kept cleared even if they're dirty and chipped, unused tools are hung up to be easily accessible. A lot of the materials are kept wherever there's space, with an assortment of boxes, or shelves, or for larger materials just hung up in the ceiling or leaning against the walls.

There's a door that leads to the residential part of the structure. While it's a cramped space, the rooms are covered with colour. Covered with tapestries, paintings, coloured pillows, art everywhere around the place. Featuring elements of life, wild joy, all the joyful emotions.

The rooms are split up into a single bedroom, a kitchen-living area combo, a wash-room and a small room that acts as office-space with documents housing the work done and plans for what work needs to be completed, as well as a studio for more art to be created.

## SE-F4TE-Q5

> ### Summary <Gabboweth>
>
> **Type**: Station<br>
> **Location**: Quesh<br>
> **Main Faction(s)**: Hutts<br>
> **Purpose**: Chemical extraction and refinement, slave housing<br>

### Brief Description <Gabboweth>

A very out of date extraction station, this was built over a century ago at this point. The station was originally tasked with Xenoboric acid extraction around Gorse. The old station showing signs of this period of its life, with paint peeling of the structure, acid burns across the metallic hull. Most of the windows on this industrial station are caked with decades of grime and wear. A more modern hangar-bay has been retrofit onto the station, capable of handling the freighters that arrive and leave the station with less effort.

The station has been moved to Quesh in the past few decades. Tasked to extract the Hutt-acid like substance on the surface. It houses a dozen shuttles that can land on the surface and are adapted to carry the acid aboard along with 5 workers, all which when docked, are parasitically attached to the station rather than landing in the hangar bays.

The inside of the station is split into three main sections. From the Hangar-bay is the only clean part of the station. This is where the refined drug is stored and accessible. There's a few services situated here facing towards those who arrive, along with some residence for those staying for a few days. This is also where the station [boss](People#borlic-snevzel) and his minions can be found, communications, everything bureaucratic. The second segment is the extraction region. Here houses the raw chemicals waiting for refinement. Here also is where the slaves find accommodation and their services. The area has raised catwalks allowing those who manage the station to always have visibility of the slave's work and whereabouts. The final region is the refinery. A grizzly place filled with pipes, loose cables, and machines working their process endlessly. Here the maintenance workshop can be found with the team of technicians working the never-ending process of keeping the station alive and the tools working. The life-support system also exists in this region.

## Gabboweth's Retreat

> ### Summary <Gabboweth>
>
> **Type**: Station<br>
> **Location**: Balamak<br>
> **Main Faction(s)**: Hutts<br>
> **Purpose**: Recreation, front-line supply, repair<br>

### Brief Description <Gabboweth>

A multi-level pleasure station turned supply depot for the Hutts. Gabboweth stood as a pleasure-resort within this region. A place that once stood for commerce, gambling, trading and enjoying oneself. The station is clad in gold, jewels, and other rich resources.

Though the jewels and gold are dulled and unclean now, with a lot of the space within now taken over to house storage, crates, resources. There's triage centers setup where swimming pools once sat, there's temporary repair posts, the region of space outside and on the hangar docks usually has dozens of ships with various forms of damage upon their hull with crews attending to each vessel.

There has been a communication station built across the bottom of the station too, allowing for FTL communication outside of the sector as well as receiving local signals as and when needed. Though the station itself is limited in defences, only with token defences as it would rely on the ships and crews docked for any defensive measures.

When last seen by Zella, the main vessels situated around would have been Mandalorian, with a few of the other major factions. Though with the change in battle, things may have changed
