### Pivrir's Respite

**Brief Description**

A small colonial settlement settled far North East from [Nevarro City](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nevarro_City "Wookiepedia"). The settlement sits at point where two lava-rivers join together, winding along the Northern and Eastern parts of the settlement. With the South being blocked with large, black hills covered in loose rocks and boulders.

The small settlement only has a few dozen structures, with housing, a cantina, storehouse, mechanic and a place for ships to land and trade. Every structure has been built elevated from the terrain, standing on narrow Ferrocrete pillars. Some structures with a section that does touch the ground for easier access but most have more temporary means of entering. From a rope-ladder that's freed by using a hook, to temporary stairs for those who had the resources and/or technical know-how. With the structures being seen to spill out over some of the river-flows.

#### Rough history

- Founded during Imperial control
- A minor bastion away from the capital for quiet independence
- When Imperial care pulled away, pirates were quick to lay their claws
- Theft arose first, tributes and enforced 'trading' pushed, before slaving began
- History since then is uncertain to Zella
