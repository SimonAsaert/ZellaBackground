## Backstory

### Childhood (0-8 yrs)

Zella was born on the flats of Nevarro, in a small mechanics workshop. Here, in [Pivrir's Respite](Locations#pivrirs-respite), her parents [Mila Del'Sarro](People#mila-delsarro) and [Berhtram Del'Sarro](People#berhtram-delsarro) started to raise her. The term "it takes a village" rang literal here, as she was one of only very few children in the society she was brought up under the care of those around in the settlement. Learning, sharing experiences with those around.

When she learnt to walk, she would be found in the workshop or around. Watching her father work, or her mother create, or talking with those who came in including the droids who came for repairs. Her father put an omnitool in her hand as soon as he could, getting her to learn some of his craft, getting her to learn how to build with her hands and the tools found around. Teaching her the ways with mechanical systems, with droids, with speeders, even later on bringing her to repairs he completed on the trader vessels that came in and out.

Though as she reached 7, these outings came to a halt. She found her father was more exasperated with things going on even with mum keeping a strong face. But there was a clear change in the society as "mean men" started appearing more often in the settlement. These "mean men" would raise their voices, wouldn't smile unless they were in the company of others, taking joy in being cruel to those less able to resist around. She quickly learnt to make herself scarce and hide away from these men when they were around.

### Caged and Traded (8-9)

Then for her, the world and life ended as she knew it. The day had gone like normal, though the "mean men" weren't around. She had been helping dad with work around the workshop with fixing up a pit-droid. As dinnertime came, the family came together, when dad seemed to notice something outside one of the windows. He went to investigate, and a few minutes later mum told Zella to go hide. She did immediately, rushing to one of the cupboards and locking up. Only a minute later, a sound of a gunshot, followed soon by screams of mum that were drowned out by the sounds around. There were cries around the settlement that she couldn't focus on, there was more sounds of gunshots around. Eventually, the cupboard she was in was thrown open, and she too was dragged out. She saw her home had been torn up, the workshop in the process of being looted, smoke rising across the town, and soon she was thrown into shackles and into a cage within one of the ships. She was with company of maybe 3 or 4 others of the town, but she didn't see her mother or father...

For the first week, she was stuck in the cage on the ship. The slavers flying around and remaining out of potential scanners and taking more secretive routes through known space. The vessel sneaking its way into Hutt Space. When they past the throes of battle, Zella could hear the pilot open up communications with someone. It would only be a few hours before the ship landed on a new planet, [Saki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Saki "Wookiepedia"). Here, those who were caught were forced out of the vessel and put into even more squallored conditions, temporary holding pens for the group. Zella remaining as close as she could to one of the village elders in the group. But after a few days, the slavers began to pull each person out one by one. Taking them to be shown and bidded on by groups and individuals. Zella having to face the same, isolated from anyone that she knew, not asked a question but just bid upon before being pulled back off stage and given a placard with a colour.

Eventually, her new masters picked her up, along with a few other new slaves of which she recognised no one. And she was brought to her new permanent home, a station in orbit of [Quesh](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quesh "Wookiepedia").

### Chemical Hatred (9)

Now began the hardest part of her life so far. In orbit of Quesh, the expectation of the new group was for them to be trained in chemical extraction. They were far from the only group, coming to face dozens if not hundreds of others going through the same process as them. The tools given were of terrible condition being incredibly cheap, stolen, broken, and usually of entirely different makes/models that were incompatible with each other. These tools would be "loaned" to the slave, with the idea that they would earn their pay by extracting chemicals on the planet's surface. This would go to "pay for the debt" that the slavers had acrewed buying them, but using the tools would slowly raise this debt too leading to individuals being stuck in this endless cycle of work.

These tools were designed for larger adults, so when Zella was given them they gave no pity, instead telling her to "figure it out". Since she now was stuck with these tools, when she wasn't in the grueling process of training, she had a little time to tinker and adapt what she had. Making use of impromptu tools, over a few days she managed to lighten some of the tools, and fix and adapt a few others to work nicer together. It wasn't easy work, especially for her, but by the time she was done there had been some notice from other slaves. Soon, when there was time and the slavers weren't around, she was helping to try and fix the tools of others in her cell, befriending a few of those stuck with her. With some of the other slaves taking small pity on the young girl being stuck there with them.

### Uneasy Meetings (10)

She never did go down to the planet surface as she was originally called to do. Her work was noticed as word of mouth spread the story of a small balosaur fixing up tools. It was one night when she was working on an extraction unit when there was a clang on the door to the cell and two larger slavers entered. They had looked around, saw Zella with a partially deconstructed extractor and wordlessly grabbed her and pulled her out of the cell. She had tried to struggle, but she was dragged in front of the owner of the station, dragged in front of **((Ben Help Me Names! Might be traded after this point so this would be a "lesser" member))**. He commented on her resourcefulness, he shared an appreciation of knowledge, he also shared how modifying the tools in her position wasn't allowed. Then he shared *"However, from the circumstances we stand in, I have a new proposition. You will work off your debts not on the planet surface, but up here. I'll task you to the workshop, you will learn from those there, and you will begin your duties there."*

And that's what happened. She was thrown in a new series of cells with new individuals. She had to adapt to the dangerous, messy environment of the station workshop. She learnt quickly that injury is common here, from cuts and burns to limb loss and blindness. It was also deafeningly loud, being situated right by the main reactors of the station. She struggled to adapt, especially with her sensitive hearing. But she learnt under the informal tutelage of the kinder members <sup>\[[1](People "Tutor 1")\] \[[2](People "Tutor 2")\] </sup> in the workshop. Starting with easier tools and slowly working upwards.

### Growing Knowledge (10-13)

During these years, the people around changed plenty, but [tutor 1](People) and [tutor 2](People) stayed the same. Helping her improve her craft, and they took time to try and protect her from the more horrible aspects of the society there. She was kept from harsher punishment, with [tutor 1](People) taking most of the blame for mistakes Zella made. Keeping her from harm as she grew in this environment.

She steadily progressed, from tools to droids, to more obscure parts. Learning from her tutors, soon trying herself to help those newer in the workshop of what to avoid, what to do. She did her best to try and learn from those who allowed her to watch them work to try and prove her place here. Though the "debt" she and others in the workshop owed would never end. They were purposefully kept lowed in this place.

### Transfering (13-15)

As time went on, Zella would grow frustrated. Each time she gained a rough mastery of a topic, she was thrown onto a new place. Never allowed to stay static with one piece of equipment, instead kept always struggling to learn this new thing, this new piece of equipment. But she would push and persevere. Eventually, with her bredth of knowledge, she was pressed into maintaining ships that would arrive in the station. Figuring out what ails the ships of slavers, Hutts, traders who arrived at the station. And eventually, she got the notice of Beldorion the Hutt.

She was bought out from under **\<Insert other hutt here\>**, brought on to service one of his lighter craft with a new team, including several service droids. The tools and equipment given here were of much higher quality, making repairing a relative breeze. This impressed her handler, who would then position her in one of his stations off Balamak, [Gabboweth's Retreat](Locations#gabboweths-retreat).

### Leading (16-18)

Here, she proved herself once more with her ability with the technology. With the greater tools, she started to thrive in this environment and was soon promoted to one of the youngest team-leads. She was given responsibility of a team of droids and two humans. Her team tasked in maintaining the station, and more frequently were being called to patch up Hutt vessels that were in the fight. The goal not to fully repair them, but to bring them to a standard enough that they could retreat back to the repair docks deeper in Hutt Space. They were instructed to never directly talk with the crew, that would be sorted by the station owners and such. But it didn't stop them seeing the crew of these vessels, with Zella starting to dream of just walking on board one of the ships one day and being whisked away.

Instead, she stayed and continued her time. Continued to work through her debts as instructed with the group she had. With them, she grew in confidence in her work, able to maintain more complicated systems than before, able to keep her droids not only maintained, but able to swap out the parts for them without too much hassle for the time and job needed. Though then the first mistake came. After one rush-job, the ship had left with one of the fuel accellerators loose. Meaning, as the ship tried to launch into hyperdrive, this part undid itself and caused a catastrophic failure.

When word came down to her team, Zella was given the instruction to right the team by finding the one who caused this. When she tried to refuse, they turned the investigation on her. It took a few days of back and forth, reprimands and harsher service, but she finally relented and gave a name. She never saw one the human who's name she had given after that point.

### Change of Ownership (26)



### Escape! (27)



### Summary

- Born and raised on Nevarro (family's escape from the over-enterprising zeal of the megacorps, and seeing destruction of their society from Death-Sticks)
- Was pushed to learn the current trade of the family, repairing farm equipment from mechanical farm equipment, to menial droids, to whatever was needed
- During childhood -> teenage years, Imperial protection waned, criminals took the opportunity to swoop in
- At first, criminals tried selling illicit goods to the locals, eventually some more enterprising began to kidnap and enslave the locals
- Her town ended up in the middle of a struggle w/criminals. There was resistance, but when the dust settled she was found in a hiding spot and hauled off to be enslaved. No clue where her family was, was just told to hide. Mother possibly taken, father was left... Or dead?
- Eventually slavers sold her to the Huts of one of their stations.
- Quickly pushed to repair and restore minor aspects of the station (in Balamak, "Gabboweth's Retreat", under Beldorion the Hutt)
- Gradually was pushed to learn more and more of station mechanics as role expanded (due to other mechanics being disappeared).
- In young-adulthood, was marked for entertainment during the service as well. Here, was introduced to stronger substances.
- And with her learnt skills, she was pushed to repair larger entities... Anything required
- As the Mando "incursion" swept the galaxy, was pushed to service customer vessels instead, maintain and repair those who landed at the station. Lots of shuttles from ones who survived attacks from the Mandos
- Learnt about more systems, different ships, different people, and the gradual evacuation of the station
- The Mandos came and liberated the area
- Was interrogated and quickly gave up a lot of information to the Mandos of what was known
- Ship descriptions, serials etc.
- Who was hauling what
- Aided in access of station's security, where people were
- Was unable to share where station was being evacuated to
- Once interrogation period ended, tried to contact home. Was told that everyone Zella cared for had either been enslaved, or killed. (Could have been an intercepted call though, as never went/got to see remains of town. Pre Mando-contact with frontier world, though this isn't know by Zella)
So focused on current existence, resuming role as general technician of station. Now more free to work on personal work alongside repairs of other vessels and the station itself.
- However, time went on and people around them seemed to begin to disappear
- What was soon noticed was a trio of human(?)s would come onto the station, and a week later they would disappear alongside the person
- Soon, it was Zella's turn to be the focus of this trio when they made friendly contact
- Zella quickly fled, joining the next ship as their maintenance/engineer lead to gtfo
- Turns out they were low-level smugglers, hauling low class illicit goods.
- On this job, they had a target in the Quelli sector
- Job went wrong, group caught up in a sting operation
- Lead to crashing on Dathomir.
- Ship in an entirely unusable state, both from the battle damage and the crash.
- However, managed to scavenge enough to keep warm, and supplies to last a short while at least.
