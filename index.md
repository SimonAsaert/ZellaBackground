## Backstory

### Childhood (0-8 yrs)

Zella was born on the flats of Nevarro, in a small mechanics workshop. Here, in [Pivrir's Respite](Locations#pivrirs-respite), her parents [Mila Del'Sarro](People#mila-delsarro) and [Berhtram Del'Sarro](People#berhtram-delsarro) started to raise her. The term "it takes a village" rang literal here, as she was one of only very few children in the society she was brought up under the care of those around in the settlement. Learning, sharing experiences with those around.

When she learnt to walk, she would be found in the workshop or around. Watching her father work, or her mother create, or talking with those who came in including the droids who came for repairs. Her father put an omnitool in her hand as soon as he could, getting her to learn some of his craft, getting her to learn how to build with her hands and the tools found around. Teaching her the ways with mechanical systems, with droids, with speeders, even later on bringing her to repairs he completed on the trader vessels that came in and out.

Though as she reached 7, these outings came to a halt. She found her father was more exasperated with things going on even with mum keeping a strong face. But there was a clear change in the society as "mean men" started appearing more often in the settlement. These "mean men" would raise their voices, wouldn't smile unless they were in the company of others, taking joy in being cruel to those less able to resist around. She quickly learnt to make herself scarce and hide away from these men when they were around.

### Caged and Traded (8-9)

Then for her, the world and life ended as she knew it. The day had gone like normal, though the "mean men" weren't around. She had been helping dad with work around the workshop with fixing up a pit-droid. As dinnertime came, the family came together, when dad seemed to notice something outside one of the windows. He went to investigate, and a few minutes later mum told Zella to go hide. She did immediately, rushing to one of the cupboards and locking up. Only a minute later, a sound of a gunshot, followed soon by screams of mum that were drowned out by the sounds around. There were cries around the settlement that she couldn't focus on, there was more sounds of gunshots around. Eventually, the cupboard she was in was thrown open, and she too was dragged out. She saw her home had been torn up, the workshop in the process of being looted, smoke rising across the town, and soon she was thrown into shackles and into a cage within one of the ships. She was with company of maybe 3 or 4 others of the town, but she didn't see her mother or father...

For the first week, she was stuck in the cage on the ship. The slavers flying around and remaining out of potential scanners. Making their way down to Hutt space. As they past the throes of battle, a lot of communication could be heard from the front before they finally landed on a new planet. The group enslaved were forced out and put into new squallored places to prepare for sale. Each person being sold individually, and split far apart.

### Summary

- Born and raised on Nevarro (family's escape from the over-enterprising zeal of the megacorps, and seeing destruction of their society from Death-Sticks)
- Was pushed to learn the current trade of the family, repairing farm equipment from mechanical farm equipment, to menial droids, to whatever was needed
- During childhood -> teenage years, Imperial protection waned, criminals took the opportunity to swoop in
- At first, criminals tried selling illicit goods to the locals, eventually some more enterprising began to kidnap and enslave the locals
- Her town ended up in the middle of a struggle w/criminals. There was resistance, but when the dust settled she was found in a hiding spot and hauled off to be enslaved. No clue where her family was, was just told to hide. Mother possibly taken, father was left... Or dead?
- Eventually slavers sold her to the Huts of one of their stations.
- Quickly pushed to repair and restore minor aspects of the station (in Balamak, "Gabboweth's Retreat", under Beldorion the Hutt)
- Gradually was pushed to learn more and more of station mechanics as role expanded (due to other mechanics being disappeared).
- In young-adulthood, was marked for entertainment during the service as well. Here, was introduced to stronger substances.
- And with her learnt skills, she was pushed to repair larger entities... Anything required
- As the Mando "incursion" swept the galaxy, was pushed to service customer vessels instead, maintain and repair those who landed at the station. Lots of shuttles from ones who survived attacks from the Mandos
- Learnt about more systems, different ships, different people, and the gradual evacuation of the station
- The Mandos came and liberated the area
- Was interrogated and quickly gave up a lot of information to the Mandos of what was known
- Ship descriptions, serials etc.
- Who was hauling what
- Aided in access of station's security, where people were
- Was unable to share where station was being evacuated to
- Once interrogation period ended, tried to contact home. Was told that everyone Zella cared for had either been enslaved, or killed. (Could have been an intercepted call though, as never went/got to see remains of town. Pre Mando-contact with frontier world, though this isn't know by Zella)
So focused on current existence, resuming role as general technician of station. Now more free to work on personal work alongside repairs of other vessels and the station itself.
- However, time went on and people around them seemed to begin to disappear
- What was soon noticed was a trio of human(?)s would come onto the station, and a week later they would disappear alongside the person
- Soon, it was Zella's turn to be the focus of this trio when they made friendly contact
- Zella quickly fled, joining the next ship as their maintenance/engineer lead to gtfo
- Turns out they were low-level smugglers, hauling low class illicit goods.
- On this job, they had a target in the Quelli sector
- Job went wrong, group caught up in a sting operation
- Lead to crashing on Dathomir.
- Ship in an entirely unusable state, both from the battle damage and the crash.
- However, managed to scavenge enough to keep warm, and supplies to last a short while at least.
