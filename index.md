## Backstory

- Born and raised on Nevarro (family's escape from the over-enterprising zeal of the megacorps, and seeing destruction of their society from Death-Sticks)
- Was pushed to learn the current trade of the family, repairing farm equipment from mechanical farm equipment, to menial droids, to whatever was needed
- During childhood -> teenage years, Imperial protection waned, criminals took the opportunity to swoop in
- At first, criminals tried selling illicit goods to the locals, eventually some more enterprising began to kidnap and enslave the locals
- Her town ended up in the middle of a struggle w/criminals. There was resistance, but when the dust settled she was found in a hiding spot and hauled off to be enslaved. No clue where her family was, was just told to hide. Mother possibly taken, father was left... Or dead?
- Eventually slavers sold her to the Huts of one of their stations.
- Quickly pushed to repair and restore minor aspects of the station (in Balamak, "Gabboweth's Retreat", under Beldorion the Hutt)
- Gradually was pushed to learn more and more of station mechanics as role expanded (due to other mechanics being disappeared).
- In young-adulthood, was marked for entertainment during the service as well. Here, was introduced to stronger substances.
- And with her learnt skills, she was pushed to repair larger entities... Anything required
- As the Mando "incursion" swept the galaxy, was pushed to service customer vessels instead, maintain and repair those who landed at the station. Lots of shuttles from ones who survived attacks from the Mandos
- Learnt about more systems, different ships, different people, and the gradual evacuation of the station
- The Mandos came and liberated the area
- Was interrogated and quickly gave up a lot of information to the Mandos of what was known
- Ship descriptions, serials etc.
- Who was hauling what
- Aided in access of station's security, where people were
- Was unable to share where station was being evacuated to
- Once interrogation period ended, tried to contact home. Was told that everyone Zella cared for had either been enslaved, or killed. (Could have been an intercepted call though, as never went/got to see remains of town. Pre Mando-contact with frontier world, though this isn't know by Zella)
So focused on current existence, resuming role as general technician of station. Now more free to work on personal work alongside repairs of other vessels and the station itself.
- However, time went on and people around them seemed to begin to disappear
- What was soon noticed was a trio of human(?)s would come onto the station, and a week later they would disappear alongside the person
- Soon, it was Zella's turn to be the focus of this trio when they made friendly contact
- Zella quickly fled, joining the next ship as their maintenance/engineer lead to gtfo
- Turns out they were low-level smugglers, hauling low class illicit goods.
- On this job, they had a target in the Quelli sector
- Job went wrong, group caught up in a sting operation
- Lead to crashing on Dathomir.
- Ship in an entirely unusable state, both from the battle damage and the crash.
- However, managed to scavenge enough to keep warm, and supplies to last a short while at least.
