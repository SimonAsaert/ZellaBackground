## Backstory

### Childhood (0-8 yrs)

Zella was born on the flats of Nevarro, in a small mechanics workshop. Here, in [Pivrir's Respite](Locations#pivrirs-respite), her parents [Mila Del'Sarro](People#mila-delsarro) and [Berhtram Del'Sarro](People#berhtram-delsarro) started to raise her. The term "it takes a village" rang literal here, as she was one of only very few children in the society she was brought up under the care of those around in the settlement. Learning, sharing experiences with those around.

When she learnt to walk, she would be found in the workshop or around. Watching her father work, or her mother create, or talking with those who came in including the droids who came for repairs. Her father put an omnitool in her hand as soon as he could, getting her to learn some of his craft, getting her to learn how to build with her hands and the tools found around. Teaching her the ways with mechanical systems, with droids, with speeders, even later on bringing her to repairs he completed on the trader vessels that came in and out.

Though as she reached 7, these outings came to a halt. She found her father was more exasperated with things going on even with mum keeping a strong face. But there was a clear change in the society as "mean men" started appearing more often in the settlement. These "mean men" would raise their voices, wouldn't smile unless they were in the company of others, taking joy in being cruel to those less able to resist around. She quickly learnt to make herself scarce and hide away from these men when they were around.

### Caged and Traded (8-9)

Then for her, the world and life ended as she knew it. The day had gone like normal, though the "mean men" weren't around. She had been helping dad with work around the workshop with fixing up a pit-droid. As dinnertime came, the family came together, when dad seemed to notice something outside one of the windows. He went to investigate, and a few minutes later mum told Zella to go hide. She did immediately, rushing to one of the cupboards and locking up. Only a minute later, a sound of a gunshot, followed soon by screams of mum that were drowned out by the sounds around. There were cries around the settlement that she couldn't focus on, there was more sounds of gunshots around. Eventually, the cupboard she was in was thrown open, and she too was dragged out. She saw her home had been torn up, the workshop in the process of being looted, smoke rising across the town, and soon she was thrown into shackles and into a cage within one of the ships. She was with company of maybe 3 or 4 others of the town, but she didn't see her mother or father...

For the first week, she was stuck in the cage on the ship. The slavers flying around and remaining out of potential scanners and taking more secretive routes through known space. The vessel sneaking its way into Hutt Space. When they past the throes of battle, Zella could hear the pilot open up communications with someone. It would only be a few hours before the ship landed on a new planet, [Saki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Saki "Wookiepedia"). Here, those who were caught were forced out of the vessel and put into even more squallored conditions, temporary holding pens for the group. Zella remaining as close as she could to one of the village elders in the group. But after a few days, the slavers began to pull each person out one by one. Taking them to be shown and bid on by groups and individuals. Zella having to face the same, isolated from anyone that she knew, not asked a question but just bid upon before being pulled back off stage and given a placard with a colour.

Eventually, her new [masters](People#borlic-snevzel) picked her up, along with a few other new slaves of which she recognised no one. And she was brought to her new permanent home, a station in orbit of [Quesh](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quesh "Wookiepedia").

### Chemical Hatred (9)

Now began the hardest part of her life so far. In orbit of Quesh, the expectation of the new group was for them to be trained in chemical extraction. They were far from the only group, coming to face dozens if not hundreds of others going through the same process as them. The tools given were incredibly cheap, stolen, broken, and usually of incompatible makes/models. These tools would be "loaned" to the slave, with the idea that they would earn their pay by extracting chemicals on the planet's surface. This would go to "pay for the debt" that the slavers had accrued buying them, but using the tools would slowly raise this debt too leading to individuals being stuck in this endless cycle of work.

These tools were designed for larger adults, so when Zella was given them they gave no pity, instead telling her to "figure it out". Since she now was stuck with these tools, when she wasn't in the gruelling process of training, she had a little time to tinker and adapt what she had. Making use of impromptu tools, over a few days she managed to lighten some of the tools, and fix and adapt a few others to work nicer together. It wasn't easy work, especially for her, but by the time she was done there had been some notice from other slaves. Soon, when there was time and the slavers weren't around, she was helping to try and fix the tools of others in her cell, befriending a few of those stuck with her. With some of the other slaves taking small pity on the young girl being stuck there with them.

### Uneasy Meetings (10)

She never did go down to the planet surface as she was originally called to do. Her work was noticed as word of mouth spread the story of a small Balosaur fixing up tools. It was one night when she was working on an extraction unit when there was a clang on the door to the cell and two larger slavers entered. They had looked around, saw Zella with a partially deconstructed extractor and wordlessly grabbed her and pulled her out of the cell. She had tried to struggle, but she was dragged in front of the owner of the station, dragged in front of [Borlic Snevzel](People#borlic-snevzel). He commented on her resourcefulness, he shared an appreciation of knowledge, he also shared how modifying the tools in her position wasn't allowed. Then he shared *"However, from the circumstances we stand in, I have a new proposition. You will work off your debts not on the planet surface, but up here. I'll task you to the workshop, you will learn from those there, and you will begin your duties there."*

And that's what happened. She was thrown in a new series of cells with new individuals. She had to adapt to the dangerous, messy environment of the station workshop. She learnt quickly that injury is common here, from cuts and burns to limb loss and blindness. It was also deafeningly loud, being situated right by the main reactors of the station. She struggled to adapt, especially with her sensitive hearing. But she learnt under the informal tutelage of the kinder members <sup>\[[1](People#vydgish-gozorc "Tutor 1")\] \[[2](People#niruhk-raokt "Tutor 2")\] </sup> in the workshop. Starting with easier tools and slowly working upwards.

### Growing Knowledge (10-13)

During these years, the people around changed plenty, but [Vydgish](People#vydgish-gozorc) and [Niruhk](People#niruhk-raokt) remained by her, helping her improve her craft, and they took time to try and protect her from the more horrible aspects of the society there. She was kept from harsher punishment, with [Vydgish](People#vydgish-gozorc) taking most of the blame for mistakes Zella made. Keeping her from harm as she grew in this environment.

She steadily progressed, from tools to droids, to more obscure parts. Learning from her tutors, soon trying herself to help those newer in the workshop of what to avoid, what to do. She did her best to try and learn from those who allowed her to watch them work to try and prove her place here. Though the "debt" she and others in the workshop owed would never end. They were purposefully kept lowed in this place.

### Transferring (13-15)

As time went on, Zella would grow frustrated. Each time she gained a rough mastery of a topic, she was thrown onto a new place. Never allowed to stay static with one piece of equipment, instead kept always struggling to learn this new thing, this new piece of equipment. But she would push and persevere. Eventually, with her breadth of knowledge, she was pressed into maintaining ships that would arrive in the station. Figuring out what ails the ships of slavers, Hutts, traders who arrived at the station. And eventually, she got the notice of Beldorion the Hutt.

She was bought out from under [Borlic Snevzel](People#borlic-snevzel). Brought on to service one of his lighter craft with a new team, including several service droids. The tools and equipment given here were of much higher quality, making repairing a relative breeze. This impressed her [handler](People#chu-vitchess), who would then position her in one of the stations off Balamak, [Gabboweth's Retreat](Locations#gabboweths-retreat).

### Leading (16-18)

Here, she proved herself once more with her ability with the technology. With the greater tools, she started to thrive in this environment and was soon promoted to one of the youngest team-leads. She was given responsibility of a team of 5 droids and two humanoids. One who was surprisingly familiar, [Niruhk](People#niruhk-raokt). Her team tasked in maintaining the station, and more frequently were being called to patch up Hutt vessels that were in the fight. The goal not to fully repair them, but to bring them to a standard enough that they could retreat back to the repair docks deeper in Hutt Space. They were instructed to never directly talk with the crew, that would be sorted by the station owners and such. But it didn't stop them seeing the crew of these vessels, with Zella starting to dream of just walking on board one of the ships one day and being whisked away.

Instead, she stayed and continued her time. Continued to work through her debts as instructed with the group she had. With them, she grew in confidence in her work, able to maintain more complicated systems than before, able to keep her droids not only maintained, but able to swap out the parts for them without too much hassle for the time and job needed. Though then the first mistake came. After one rush-job, the ship had left with one of the fuel accelerators loose. Meaning, as the ship tried to launch into hyperdrive, this part undid itself and caused a catastrophic failure.

When word came down to her team, Zella was given the instruction to right the team by finding the one who caused this. When she tried to refuse, they turned the investigation on her. It took a few days of back and forth, reprimands and harsher service, but she finally relented and gave a name. She never saw one the human who's name she had given after that point.

Over the months to her 18th, she was pressed to give more names when even minor incidents arose. Each time, letting go of one of her team as they would usually be disappeared, or end up wiped and reformatted and ready for use. With these actions, a distrust grew within her team, a concern that the next slip-up would lead to them disappearing. While Zella kept the fact she was the one giving a name to herself, the others were still worried for their own safety... And for a while things did get worse and more mistakes were made, but soon these did slow as the team just focused on "get the job done".

### Interstellar Development (18-20)

During her latter years under ownership, she had developed enough in the station that she was giving recommendations of what could be improved. Most of the time, it would be miner alterations, a process change, better power delivery here for optimisation, leaving tools in more efficiently placed spots. She was even reported to share her belief in improvements for some of the vessels that arrived. Taking into account the damage they received she'd suggest layout changes to improve their survivability. This clear growth in ambition brought the curiosity of her [handler](People#chu-vitchess), who reported upwards. And soon, she was brought before one a little under the Hutt. He shared his plans to improve communications across the sector, before pushing a map to Zella and requesting for suggestions. In this impromptu "interview", she asked a few questions of what's happening, where certain things are, even requesting some charts of existing relays before she gave her answer to the tired higher-up. Sharing the locations they should be, before giving a suggestion of how they should work with the fighting going on to give central command an extreme amount of visibility without being detected. She was dismissed quickly afterwards.

It would be days before she heard back, how her team would be tasked off-station, and begin to bring some communication satellites online and to "do whatever it would take to ensure communication remains secure secure". Her team and herself were given 2 hours to prepare, bundling what little belongings they had left before they were placed aboard a ship and flew off.

Her team and herself would be situated on the ship, doing work aboard the vessel and space-walks to try and situate the first of many satellites into place. This would would go on for days and it would only be when they were returning that Zella would realise this satellite was in one of the places she had suggested. Her team would complete half a dozen more of these jobs, setting up a string of new covert satellites in the Balamak sector. Each were tuned to transmit signals between themselves and [Gabboweth's Retreat](Locations#gabboweths-retreat). They would be receiving signals from the sector, automatically filtering/tagging them to the known factions in the sector before they would send their payload along. Only transmitting to Hutt vessels when absolutely.

This covert work was in place to give the Hutts visibility of the sector, giving them an advantage here that they didn't once have, albeit showing to them the sheer size of the force they were trying to fight here. With her plan and actions helping to keep some sort of hold in the sector, this was appreciated with most of her debt being wiped at once. But not all of it.

Zella and her team would now be tasked to deploy similar measures over the border regions where possible. In places that would have a station that could receive such information under worry that transmitting down to the planet would be "too noisy" for the covert needs. While doing this, they would also be tasked to assist in repairs of vessels in the region, just as before bringing them to enough life that they could return to a dry-dock or within a towing station. Now, with the rough grace of her [handler](People#chu-vitchess), she was allowed to start talking with the teams that they came in contact with. Albeit with said [handler](People#chu-vitchess) always hovering in the area to ensure everything was "above board". This was not enough to gain any sort of relationship with them beyond their formal talks, but enough to gain a tiny bit of visibility.

### Trading and Building (20-26)

With her being given some level of visibility, her team and herself would soon be given tasks a little wider around Hutt Space. Being made to repair larger stations, being told to improve more basic designs, being pressed into working for the Hutts and their many mercenaries directly. She never got fame from this, as any work she completed was done under the name of Beldorion the Hutt, but her team and herself would end up close as they worked together. With Zella leading technically, [person 2] leading the team, and the rest working on what was needed. Eventually, her team and herself would find themselves back to [Gabboweth's Retreat](Locations#gabboweths-retreat), tasked to work with those on board to complete repairs from a recent assault.

### Freedom? (26)

The work she was doing was far from fast enough. Perhaps through sabotage, perhaps through luck, the station's sensors were offline when the Mando assault swept through. Herself and other engineers hiding and surrendering themselves when the opportunity arose, including Zella. She gave herself up willingly to the Mandalorians, and in turn was thrown into intensive interrogation. She gave up details on vessels, on locations, on herself. Perhaps through pride, perhaps through fear of retribution, she didn't give up the sensitive locations of her sensor stations. Instead, when the opportunity came, she had one of her droids cut the communication line before wiping any such instructions from themselves. Plus, the Mandalorians were given plenty of usable information on the vessels they were facing, so they were happy with what was traded.

Then, she was given a freedom she hadn't had since she was a child. Allowed to do as she wanted. It took a while, but she managed to have a message transmitted to her home, asking if her mum or dad were there. It was days before there was any reply, but it was a firm "There hasn't been someone of the Sel'Darro family here for the past 18 cycles". So, with what she felt was nothing to return to, she instead agreed with the Mandos to work on the station. To complete the repairs there and perhaps begin maintaining the station further as needed.

It would only be a few months before something was suspicious. Those who remained on the station now liberated, they would begin to seemingly disappear. The Mandalorians didn't seem to pay much attention, they were busy strategising and trying to keep the station from falling to enemy hands. But there were rumours that those who were disappearing would meet new individuals. These individuals would talk, discuss something. And between a few hours to a day, that individual would disappear.

### Escape! (27)

Then Zella met two strange individuals. They approached, offering her prospects aboard a new station. She talked with them, asking questions and only getting vague responses. Something about engineering work in the core sectors, about having potential for good pay, but nothing concrete. She knew she was being targetted, so in the first opportunity, she fled. Boarding an out-bound vessel and stowing herself away with them.

When they were in hyperspace, she made the shocked crew aware of her presence. She would share how she needed to get away, before offering her services to the crew. It was during their debate when their pleasure-yacht would be forced out of hyperspace as the drive span itself down, and a curse would be heard from the pilot. She proved herself to the team, soon finding the fault with the engine (surge protection being too sensitive or some such) and after fiddling around, the vessel would fly as-expected. They would accept her on the spot.

It was then that she would learn of their true intentions. The adolescent Hutt was attempting to circumvent the Twi'lek spice trade, to buy and sell spice himself without any middle-men. He was on his second journey as the first had been "such an incredible success, I had to pull a crew together to do this properly".

Their destination was around the [Quelli sector](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Quelli_sector "Wookiepedia"), and on arrival the ship was instantly pinged by an awaiting sting operation. The pilot struggling to manoeuvre away and would crash the ship on Dathomir under the belief that "No one would be crazy enough to follow us down here..!" Zella was the only survivor after having strapped herself to a structural part of the hull.
